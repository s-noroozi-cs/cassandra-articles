Data replication

	Cassandra stores replicas on multiple nodes to ensure reliability and fault tolerance. 
	A replication strategy determines the nodes where replicas are placed. 
	The total number of replicas across the cluster is referred to as the replication factor. 
	A replication factor of 1 means that there is only one copy of each row in the cluster. 
	If the node containing the row goes down, the row cannot be retrieved. 
	A replication factor of 2 means two copies of each row, where each copy is on a different node. 
	All replicas are equally important; there is no primary or master replica. 
	As a general rule, the replication factor should not exceed the number of nodes in the cluster. 
	However, you can increase the replication factor and then add the desired number of nodes later.

	Two replication strategies are available:

		- SimpleStrategy: 
			Use only for a single datacenter and one rack. 
			If you ever intend more than one datacenter, use the NetworkTopologyStrategy.

		- NetworkTopologyStrategy: 
			Highly recommended for most deployments because it is much easier to expand to multiple datacenters 
			when required by future expansion.

	SimpleStrategy
		Use only for a single datacenter and one rack. 
		SimpleStrategy places the first replica on a node determined by the partitioner. 
		Additional replicas are placed on the next nodes clockwise in the ring without 
		considering topology (rack or datacenter location).

	NetworkTopologyStrategy
		Use NetworkTopologyStrategy when you have (or plan to have) your cluster deployed across multiple datacenters. 
		This strategy specifies how many replicas you want in each datacenter.
		
		NetworkTopologyStrategy places replicas in the same datacenter by walking the ring clockwise until reaching 
		the first node in another rack. 

		NetworkTopologyStrategy attempts to place replicas on distinct racks because nodes in the 
		same rack (or similar physical grouping) often fail at the same time due to power, cooling, or network issues.

	When deciding how many replicas to configure in each datacenter, the two primary considerations are 
	(1) being able to satisfy reads locally, without incurring cross data-center latency, and 
	(2) failure scenarios. 

	The two most common ways to configure multiple datacenter clusters are:
		- Two replicas in each datacenter: 
			This configuration tolerates the failure of a single node per replication group and 
			still allows local reads at a consistency level of ONE.

		- Three replicas in each datacenter: 
			This configuration tolerates either the failure of one node per replication group at a strong consistency level 
			of LOCAL_QUORUM or multiple node failures per datacenter using consistency level ONE.

	Asymmetrical replication groupings are also possible. 
	For example, you can have three replicas in one datacenter to serve real-time application requests 
	and use a single replica elsewhere for running analytics.

	Replication strategy is defined per keyspace, and is set during keyspace creation.

	Counters
		The counter type is used to define counter columns. A counter column is a column whose value is a 64-bit signed integer and on which 2 operations are supported: incrementing and decrementing (see the UPDATE statement for syntax). 
		Note that the value of a counter cannot be set: a counter does not exist until first incremented/decremented, 
		and that first increment/decrement is made as if the prior value was 0.

		Counters have a number of important limitations:
			- They cannot be used for columns part of the PRIMARY KEY of a table.
			- A table that contains a counter can only contain counters. In other words, 
			  either all the columns of a table outside the PRIMARY KEY have the counter type, or none of them have it.
			- Counters do not support expiration.
			- The deletion of counters is supported, but is only guaranteed to work the first time you delete a counter. 
			  In other words, you should not re-update a counter that you have deleted 
			  (if you do, proper behavior is not guaranteed).
			- Counter updates are, by nature, not idemptotent. An important consequence is that if a 
			  counter update fails unexpectedly (timeout or loss of connection to the coordinator node), 
			  the client has no way to know if the update has been applied or not. 
			  In particular, replaying the update may or may not lead to an over count.


	Working with timestamps
		Values of the timestamp type are encoded as 64-bit signed integers representing a number of milliseconds since the standard base time known as the epoch: January 1 1970 at 00:00:00 GMT.
		
		Timestamps can be input in CQL either using their value as an integer, or using a string that represents an ISO 8601 date. For instance, all of the values below are valid timestamp values for Mar 2, 2011, at 04:05:00 AM, GMT:

		- 1299038700000
		- '2011-02-03 04:05+0000'
		- '2011-02-03 04:05:00+0000'
		- '2011-02-03 04:05:00.000+0000'
		- '2011-02-03T04:05+0000'
		- '2011-02-03T04:05:00+0000'
		- '2011-02-03T04:05:00.000+0000'

		The +0000 above is an RFC 822 4-digit time zone specification; +0000 refers to GMT. US Pacific Standard Time is -0800. 
		The time zone may be omitted if desired ('2011-02-03 04:05:00'), and if so, the date will be interpreted as being in the time zone under which the coordinating Cassandra node is configured. There are however difficulties inherent in relying on the time zone configuration being as expected, so it is recommended that the time zone always be specified for timestamps when feasible.
		
		The time of day may also be omitted ('2011-02-03' or '2011-02-03+0000'), in which case the time of day will default to 00:00:00 in the specified or default time zone. However, if only the date part is relevant, consider using the date type.


	Date type
		Values of the date type are encoded as 32-bit unsigned integers representing a number of days with “the epoch” at the center of the range (2^31). Epoch is January 1st, 1970

		For timestamps, a date can be input either as an integer or using a date string. In the later case, the format should be yyyy-mm-dd (so '2011-02-03' for instance).

	Time type
		Values of the time type are encoded as 64-bit signed integers representing the number of nanoseconds since midnight.
		
		For timestamps, a time can be input either as an integer or using a string representing the time. In the later case, the format should be hh:mm:ss[.fffffffff] (where the sub-second precision is optional and if provided, can be less than the nanosecond). So for instance, the following are valid inputs for a time:
		- '08:12:54'
		- '08:12:54.123'
		- '08:12:54.123456'
		- '08:12:54.123456789'

	Duration type
		Values of the duration type are encoded as 3 signed integer of variable lengths. 
		The first integer represents the number of months, the second the number of days and the third the number of nanoseconds. This is due to the fact that the number of days in a month can change, and a day can have 23 or 25 hours depending on the daylight saving. Internally, the number of months and days are decoded as 32 bits integers whereas the number of nanoseconds is decoded as a 64 bits integer.

		A duration can be input as:
			- (quantity unit)+ like 12h30m where the unit can be:
				- y: years (12 months)
				- mo: months (1 month)
				- w: weeks (7 days)
				- d: days (1 day)
				- h: hours (3,600,000,000,000 nanoseconds)
				- m: minutes (60,000,000,000 nanoseconds)
				- s: seconds (1,000,000,000 nanoseconds)
				- ms: milliseconds (1,000,000 nanoseconds)
				- us or µs : microseconds (1000 nanoseconds)
				- ns: nanoseconds (1 nanosecond)
			- ISO 8601 format: P[n]Y[n]M[n]DT[n]H[n]M[n]S or P[n]W
			- ISO 8601 alternative format: P[YYYY]-[MM]-[DD]T[hh]:[mm]:[ss]

		Duration columns cannot be used in a table’s PRIMARY KEY. 
		This limitation is due to the fact that durations cannot be ordered. 
		It is effectively not possible to know if 1mo is greater than 29d without a date context.
		A 1d duration is not equal to a 24h one as the duration type has been created to be able to support daylight saving.

	Collections
		CQL supports three kinds of collections: maps, sets and lists.
		Note however that neither bind_marker nor NULL are supported inside collection literals.

		Noteworthy characteristics
			Collections are meant for storing/denormalizing relatively small amount of data. 
			They work well for things like “the phone numbers of a given user”, “labels applied to an email”, etc. 
			But when items are expected to grow unbounded (“all messages sent by a user”, “events registered by a sensor”…​), then collections are not appropriate and a specific table (with clustering columns) should be used. Concretely, (non-frozen) collections have the following noteworthy characteristics and limitations:

			- Individual collections are not indexed internally. Which means that even to access a single element of 
			  a collection, the while collection has to be read (and reading one is not paged internally).
			- While insertion operations on sets and maps never incur a read-before-write internally, 
			  some operations on lists do. Further, some lists operations are not idempotent by nature 
			  (see the section on lists below for details), making their retry in case of timeout problematic. 
			  It is thus advised to prefer sets over lists when possible.

		Please note that while some of those limitations may or may not be removed/improved upon in the future, it is a anti-pattern to use a (single) collection to store large amounts of data.

		Maps
			A map is a (sorted) set of key-value pairs, where keys are unique and the map is sorted by its keys.

		Sets
			A set is a (sorted) collection of unique values. 

		Lists
			A list is a (sorted) collection of non-unique values where elements are ordered by there position in the list. 

	User-Defined Types (UDTs)
		CQL support the definition of user-defined types (UDTs). Such a type can be created, modified and removed using the create_type_statement, alter_type_statement and drop_type_statement described below. But once created, a UDT is simply referred to by its name:
			user_defined_type::= udt_name
			udt_name::= [ keyspace_name '.' ] identifier

		Things to keep in mind about UDTs:
			
			- Attempting to create an already existing type will result in an error unless the IF NOT EXISTS option is used. 
			  If it is used, the statement will be a no-op if the type already exists.
			
			- A type is intrinsically bound to the keyspace in which it is created, and can only be used in that keyspace. 
			  At creation, if the type name is prefixed by a keyspace name, it is created in that keyspace. 
			  Otherwise, it is created in the current keyspace.
			
			- As of Cassandra , UDT have to be frozen in most cases, hence the frozen<address> in the table definition above.
			  Please see the section on frozen for more details.

	Tuples
		CQL also support tuples and tuple types (where the elements can be of different types). 
		Functionally, tuples can be though as anonymous UDT with anonymous fields.

		Unlike other composed types, like collections and UDTs, a tuple is always frozen <frozen> 
		(without the need of the frozen keyword) and it is not possible to update only some elements of a tuple 
		(without updating the whole tuple). Also, a tuple literal should always have the same number of value 
		than declared in the type it is a tuple of (some of those values can be null but they need to be explicitly declared as so).

	Custom Types
		A custom type is defined by:
			custom_type::= string

		A custom type is a string that contains the name of Java class that extends the server side AbstractType class and that can be loaded by Cassandra (it should thus be in the CLASSPATH of every node running Cassandra). That class will define what values are valid for the type and how the time sorts when used for a clustering column. For any other purpose, a value of a custom type is the same than that of a blob, and can in particular be input using the blob literal syntax.

	We’ve been trying out Cassandra for more than a year(2010-2011). 
	Cassandra is now serving a handful of use cases ranging from write-heavy logging and tracking, to mixed workload. 
	One of them serves our “Social Signal” project, which enables like/own/want features on eBay product pages. 
	A few use cases have reached production, while more are in development.

	Our Cassandra deployment is not huge, but it’s growing at a healthy pace. 
	In the past couple of months, we’ve deployed dozens of nodes across several small clusters spanning multiple data centers. 
	You may ask, why multiple clusters? 
		We isolate clusters by functional area and criticality. 
		Use cases with similar criticality from the same functional area share the same cluster, 
		but reside in different keyspaces.

	RedLaser, Hunch, and other eBay adjacencies are also trying out Cassandra for various purposes. 
	In addition to Cassandra, we also utilize MongoDB and HBase. 
	I won’t discuss these now, but suffice it to say we believe each has its own merit.
